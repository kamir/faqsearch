4,2014-08-16T14:00:04Z, mirko.kaempf@cloudera.com, How can I update the index after I changed the schema?, SOLR schema change, BDA, Answer from stackoverflow.com:  <br/>You have to reindex. There is no other way around it. Indexing is a destructive process with relation to its input: text is sliced and diced to make it faster for search so you can't recover the original text unless you had it in a stored field. (stored=true in your Solr field definition in schema.xml). If you did have it in a stored field all you have to do is a little process to iterate through the documents and just re-send them so they're reindexed. <br/> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6038920/updating-solr-schema
